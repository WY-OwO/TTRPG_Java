    <h2>Game Rules</h2>
    <h3>Background</h3>
    <p>You're a group of survivors in a bunker waiting for the 
        Z-Virus to die dow. There are vicious flesh-eating monsters 
        roaming the surface. One member has to go out and scavenge 
        once per day with the one hazmat suit and weapons available for 
        use. However, there is a villain and a detective among the group. 
        The villain wants the bunker all to themselves and a crush of theirs 
        so that they may be the leaders of a brand new world when the virus ends; 
        while the detective had been tracking down the villain for years, finally 
        have this opportunity to bring them to justice but is, in the end, a 
        one-man army, so will have to take advantage of the innocents to 
        bring the villain to justice.
        <br>Will the survivors find out the villain and their crush before 
        they're all eliminated? </p>

    <h3>Preparation</h3>
    <p>This RPG requires a minimum of 10 players and a game master (GM).</p>
    <p>This RPG will need a random name generator, random number generators for each player and one for 
        monster attack, a coin or coin-flip generator, and 
        a paper or shared document between players for recording health points (HP).
    </p>

    <h3>Roles</h3>
    <p>Players draw a folded paper from a pile of papers with roles written on each of them. Number of 
        roles should match the players amount, with one villain, one detective, and the rest survivor.
    </p>

        <div id="big-table">
            <div>
                <h3>Survivor</h3>
                <p>Stay alive and eliminate the villain or the villain’s crush, 
                    as when the crush’s eliminated, the villain loses.</p>
            </div>

        <div id="big-table">

                <h3>Villain</h3>
                <p>Eliminate all survivors until there are only two and the villain’s crush remaining. 
                Keep the villain’s crush alive.</p>

                <h3>Detective</h3>
                <p>Influence the survivors to follow your lead and eliminate the villain or villain crush. 
                    Be aware of the chance that the survivors might mistaken you for the villain.</p>
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>Villain crush may be chosen with everyone closing their eyes and villain points at a player. This decision 
        cannot be changed for the rest of the game. 
    </p>

    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <h4>Health Points (HP)</h4>
    <p>All players start out with 5 HP. Once health reaches 0, the player is “dead” and out of the game. 
        There is no upper limit on health points per player.</p>
    
    <h4>Scavenge</h4>
    <p>One player, whether volunteered or nominated, will choose between going to the 
        safe residential area or go further away from the base to the unknown distance (other players will 
        NOT know what the random generated choices will be). This decision may not be reversed.</p>
    <p><b>Location - Safe Residential Area: </b>
    <br>No monsters in sight, a guaranteed safe trip back and forth, but can only get level 1 resources.</p>
    <p><b>Location - mystery roll: </b>
    <br>Scavenger will be separated from the rest of the group (whether it be walking to the other end of the 
        or a new chatroom) and will be assisted by the GM to see the result of the random scavenge prompt generator. 
        Random prompts may not be rerolled. Scavenger must choose one of the two prompts to do. The available level 
        of resources available directly equals to the monsters that must be defeated to obtain all resources. 
    <br>First two monsters will have 5HP respectfully, and the third having 8HP. Scavenger will be fighting with 
        their original HP. 
    <br>Scavenger will fight the monsters individually by rolling d8 to deal damage. Each defeated monster will add 
        2 HP to the scavenger for the next round(s). Monsters, controlled by the GM, rolls d5 to deal damage.
    <br>1 monster defeated will earn scavenger 1 resource (accumulate level by how much monster is defeated). 
        If there's <b>more resources than monsters</b>, scavenger will only have to defeat all monsters to get the 
        highest level of resource available. If there's <b>more monsters than resources</b>, scavenger should 
        defeat the monsters equivilant to the level of resource(s), then can choose to fight the remaining monster(s) 
        or run away. Run away needs a d6 roll of 4 or above to count as a successful escape, otherwise they may 
        reroll after the monster gets an attack roll. Scavenger may choose to run away any time during the battle too.
    <br>If scavenger "dies" to the first monster, scavenger is deemed "dead" and eliminated from the game. No resources 
        acquired.
    <br>If scavenger "dies" to the second monster, scavenger returns to group with level 1 resource. Original HP minus 1.
    <br>If scavenger "dies" to the third monster, scavenger returns to the group with level 2 resource. Original HP minus 2.
    <br>If scavenger defeats all monsters, scavenger returns with level 3 resource. HP remains whatever is left after battle.</p>

    <div id="hp-table">
        <div>
            <h4>Resources</h4>
            <h4>Multiply Players amount*</h4>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="hp-table">
        <div>
            <h4>Lvl 1</h4>
            <p>25%</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="hp-table">
        <div>
            <h4>Lvl 2</h4>
            <p>50%</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div id="hp-table">
        <div>
            <h4>Lvl 3</h4>
            <p>75%</p>
        </div>
    </div>
    <p>*Exclude "dead" players; round down result if needed</p>
    
    <p>Scavenger will have the ultimate saying in who gets resources, but is free to hear suggestions. 
        One resource will add 1 HP to designated player.
    </p>
    <p><b>Villain/Detective perk:</b>
    <br>If villain/detective is the scavenger, they get to roll three times each attack, and pick which rolled 
        result they want to use.</p>
    <p><b>Detective benefit:</b>
    <br>If detective is scavenger and retrieves Lvl 2 resource or higher, they will earn an extra rolling 
        chance at night to find who the villain or villain crush is.</p>

    <h3>Team Task</h3>
    <p>Those who are not scavenger will spread themselves into no more than 10 groups. Groups doens't have to be 
        evenly spread.
    <br>GM will roll the Teamwork Prompt Generator to get 5 random tasks (no reroll on the same day). 
        Each task will have different HP amount on the line. Every group will choose one task to do. 
    <br>Players will roll d6 to indicate whether the task is completed or failed. If half of the group members 
        roll 4 - 6, the task is complete with no consequences. Otherwise, the task is failed and all members 
        lose the corresponding HP. If there's an odd number of members, round down for how much members to qualify 
        a win roll. 
    <br>After the team task, all players can have a discussion about the progression of the game while the GM 
        assist the scavenger with their procedure. 
    </p>
    <p><b>Villain/Detective perk:</b>
    <br>Villain/Detective may roll three times and pick which rolled result they want to use.</p>
    <p><b>Detective benefit:</b>
    <br>If detective's group completed their task, the detective will earn an extra rolling chance at night to 
        find who the villain or villain crush is.</p>

    <h3>HP Shifting</h3>
    <p>All players will flip a coin to randomly determine if they can move HP or not.
    <br>Player must move HP if they got the opportunity. 
    <br>Those who got the opportunity must also roll a d6 to determine how much HP they must move.
    </p>

    <h3>Night - Villain Activity</h3>
    <p>When villain wakes up at night, they must choose to do one of the following:
    <br><b>Complete shift HP: </b>redistribute up to 3 HP in total. 
    <br>OR
    <br><b>Shift and Sabotage: </b>
    </p>Villain shifts 1 HP but sabotage the scavenge equipment for the following day only, resulting in scavenger 
    damage roll shrink to d5 instead. 

    <h3>Night - Detective Activity</h3>
    <p>When detective wakes up at night, they will roll a d6 to determine whether they can point at a player and 
        check their identity with the GM. A roll from 4-6 will grant them the chance to check.
    <br>If detective earned a chance to roll during daytime (whether through scavenge or complete task, see above), 
        they may roll now.
    </p>
