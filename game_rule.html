    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <h4>Health Points (HP)</h4>
    <p>All players start out with 5 HP. Once health reaches 0, the player is “dead” and out of the game. 
        There is no upper limit on health points per player.</p>
    
    <h4>Scavenge</h4>
    <p>One player, whether volunteered or nominated, will choose between going to the 
        safe residential area or go further away from the base to the unknown distance (other players will 
        NOT know what the random generated choices will be).</p>
    <p><b>Location - Safe Residential Area: </b>
    <br>No monsters in sight, a guaranteed safe trip back and forth, but can only get level 1 resources.</p>
    <p><b>Location - mystery roll: </b>
    <br>Scavenger will be separated from the rest of the group (whether it be walking to the other end of the 
        or a new chatroom) and will be assisted by the GM to see the result of the random scavenge prompt generator. 
        Random prompts may not be rerolled. Scavenger must choose one of the two prompts to do. The available level 
        of resources available directly equals to the monsters that must be defeated to obtain all resources. 
    <br>1 monster defeated will earn scavenger 1 resource (accumulate level by how much monster is defeated). 
        If there's <b>more resources than monsters</b>, scavenger will only have to defeat all monsters to get the 
        highest level of resource available. If there's <b>more monsters than resources</b>, scavenger should 
        defeat the monsters equivilant to the level of resource(s), then can choose to fight the remaining monster(s) 
        or run away. Run away needs a d6 roll of 4 or above to count as a successful escape, otherwise they may 
        reroll after the monster gets an attack roll. Scavenger may choose to run away any time during the battle too.
    <br>If scavenger "dies" to the first monster, scavenger is deemed "dead" and eliminated from the game. No resources 
        acquired.
    <br>If scavenger "dies" to the second monster, scavenger returns to group with level 1 resource. Original HP minus 1.
    <br>If scavenger "dies" to the third monster, scavenger returns to the group with level 2 resource. Original HP minus 2.
    <br>If scavenger defeats all monsters, scavenger returns with level 3 resource. HP remains whatever is left after battle.</p>
